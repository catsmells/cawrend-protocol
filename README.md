# cawrend-protocol
Work-in-Progress testing repository for a decentralized industrial blockchain protocol.

## Important Notes
- This repository will likely be displayed as a rather incomplete one. I'll only be publishing the individual files that pass the tests required by the concept itself, which will be posted publicly at a later date.
- Not all files posted are going to be the complete ones. Again, audits for a WIP protocol aren't fun and take a while to put out - especially for one as complex as this.

This is a repository for the utilitarian fork of the CAW protocol.

## Current To-Do
~~- Make two tokens, one internal for sole governance, and the other for public accessibility.~~

Initial Supply: 314,159,265,359 TUUP
